> This is a accumulation of everything that I have learned during my time in Programming I applied in to this small C# programmed Adventure Game on the Console Interface.

Despite all the work I've done and going over a few videos and extra materials, this was not the final project for the class. That would be the Character Creator Application. I do wonder if the code still works on newer versions of C# or so.

> This is another accumulation of everything that I have learned in Programming II applied to this Final Project for that class.

This is the project where I think have understood on coding between a GUI and raw code. Coded this as Console Application first, practicing object-oriented programming principals. Then I slowly started figuring out the user interface in this version.

> A guessing game where you have to connect neighboring letters to form a word. Simple premise, hard to master.

Getting this to work was a hassle but it took some fixing on some if statements to get the grid working, along with how it checks for the nearest neighboring letter.

> A game where you have to guess a correct 5 letter word.

In the console version that I made before moving to the WPF, I learned about how I can manipulate or modify strings directly (e.g, Capitalizing a specific letter)

I forgot to show this here back on 2021. This was a Final Project assignment for the first programming class.

> A WPF application about making things using items that do not make sense

I made the inventory system too complicated in this one... passing instances between inventories and making items and currency finite for the shop took a lot of my time trying to fix the quirks and issues.

This was also the application where I try reading external files (implemented) and also tried writing external files from the application itself (not implemented, I did not get it to work)

> A console application that I tried my best in making a simple game from scratch, three card games coded around commonalities

I had a hard time figuring out child classes since they didn't do what I thought they would do. Still, a lot of reuse and stuff regarding methods!

> Another console application that randomizes the orders that the questions are given and the answers as well. It is still about programmer knowledge.
