This is a accumulation of everything that I have learned during my time in Programming I applied in to this small C# programmed Adventure Game on the Console Interface.

This is another accumulation of everything that I have learned in Programming II applied to this Final Project for that class.

I forgot to show this here back on 2021. This was a Final Project assignment for the first programming class.

A handbook that generates and reads specific .txt files of programming terms and also a pop quiz application for those terms at the same time.

A console application that tests exploration and progression via items and interaction for the player.

## [Underwater Creatures](https://github.com/VN-That1Guy/CreaturesOfTheSeaWithJSON)*
![Image of Sea Creatures](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VN-That1Guy/VN-That1Guy.github.io/1aa3d6dd764c970de1d180f18985adc0c09d08a7/images/SeaCreatures.jpg)
A console application about interacting with underwater creatures that further utilizes the IO file system to write and read a generated .txt file for users to add in their own custom creature.

## [Shift Cipher](https://github.com/VN-That1Guy/SubstitutionCipher)*
![Image of Shift Cipher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VN-That1Guy/VN-That1Guy.github.io/1aa3d6dd764c970de1d180f18985adc0c09d08a7/images/ShiftCypher.jpg)
An application that encrypts and decrypts any input that the user gives.

## [Shift Cipher GUI](https://github.com/VN-That1Guy/SubstitutionCipherGUI)
![Image of Shift Cipher GUI version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VN-That1Guy/VN-That1Guy.github.io/main/images/SubstitutionCipherGUI.png)
An easier accessible GUI version of the above application. You know, for the cool kidz!

## [Programming Trivia Game](https://github.com/VN-That1Guy/ProgrammingTriviaApplication)

Another console application that randomizes the orders that the questions are given and the answers as well. It is still about programmer knowledge.

## [Too Early Cant Think: An Explorable Areas GUI](https://github.com/VN-That1Guy/TooEarlyCantThinkGUI)
![Image of TooEarlyCantThinkGUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VN-That1Guy/VN-That1Guy.github.io/main/images/TooEarlyCantThinkGUI.png)
Another Console Application translated into GUI form. No images are present, however.
