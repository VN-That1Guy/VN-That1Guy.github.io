# About
    Hi there, I am a game designer. It is a broad role but I prefer to be on the programming/scripting side of designing for gameplay. I tackle with art assets if I need to blockout something for game prototypes. I am all about game feel or juiciness.

    So far for experience I've worked on small community or mod projects for existing games as various roles. I've done weapon sound designing for a Half-Life 2 Multiplayer mod called Zombie Master: Reborn and a Garry's Mod community server hosting a gamemode called Players Vs. Boss.
    There is one community for a game called Killing Floor where I've spent about 3 years as a gameplay programmer that features my proudest work so far, however. The community is called Siren Torturers and I've helped with scripting, modelling, texturing, and sound designing for their server. Things like custom weapons, custom enemies, how the gamemode behaves, and general maintenance when updating existing codebase. I think my time in that community was the most valuable in my experience for working with people, code that was already written, and learning another scripting language.

    Speaking of Killing Floor, that is my favorite game.
